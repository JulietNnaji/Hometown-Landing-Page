            LAGOS
          </h1>
          <p>
            Lagos, Nigeria's largest city, sprawls inland from the Gulf of Guinea across Lagos Lagoon. 
            Victoria Island, the financial center of the metropolis, is known for its beach resorts, 
            boutiques and nightlife. 
            To the north, Lagos Island is home to the National Museum Lagos, displaying cultural artifacts and craftworks. 
            Nearby is Freedom Park, once a colonial-era prison and now a major venue for concerts and public events
            <br />
            <br />
Lagos State has been inhabited for years by various indigenous ethnic groups, primarily the majority Yoruba people that live throughout the state but also the Ewe and Ogu peoples in the far west. As a result of migration since the nineteenth century, Lagos State also has large populations of non-native Nigerian ethnic groups with Edo, Fulani, Hausa, Igbo, Ijaw, Ibibio, and Nupe peoples among other Nigerian groups.

                        Title: Traffic Thoughts
                    </div>
                A meter from my nose is a smiling garbage 
                <br />
                A man's height, six feet tall
                <br />
                Caught in the middle of a gutter's pulsating stench
                <br />
                This alluring smoky weed drifts past my nostrils, 
                <br />
                Coming from a man who I assume to be the conductor.
                <br />
                <em>
                "Alaye no enter if you no hold your change ooo"
            </em>
            <br />
            <br />
                In Lagos, there is always traffic; 
                <br />
                Roadblocked bumper-to-bumper traffic 
                <br />
                With fast and furious merchants with wares on their heads
                <br />
                That is as constant as the sunset
                <br />
                <br />
                Being stuck in a traffic jam
                <br />
                Heart aching
                <br />
                Head spinning
                <br />
                My thoughts played a game of hiding and seeking answers 
                <br />
                To the tales of ancestors retold by descendants
                <br />
                <br />
                As I sat in this yellow dragon
                <br />
                Whose foggy smokes could bake bread for the whole Agege city 
                <br />
                As it conveyed us from Mainland to Island

                </div>
                12
                <br />
Papa rode me through hell
<br />
Throating my Adam's-apple 
<br/>
Yet I was not his Eve
<br />
<br />
On the last night 
<br />
He slid in-between my snail 
<br />
That sailed out of his dangling anchor
<br />
In-between his legs
<br />
I nudged him to the other side of the wall 
<br />
With the new kitchen knife mama bought
<br />
<br />
15
<br />
Mama died and took my voice 
<br />
Along with her to hades
<br />
<br />
They said the grief was inexplicable
<br />
The loss feeling unbearable
<br />
And the bereavement; never-ending
<br />
Especially when my face depicted the past 
<br />
Like a movie on replay 
<br />
<br />
25
They lied
<br />
<br />
They said I would be a computer scientist
<br />
Before my 22nd birthday 
<br />
After I wrote SSCE at 16

                    Who would then answer the question why
                   <br /> 
                   Iya Bilike is using my jamb past questions to grow her Akara business
                   <br />
                   Even when I kept exceeding the cut-off mark?
                  <br />
                  <br />
                   28
                   <br />
                   Struggling jobless in the city looking for work 
                   <br />
                   Frozen tears of frustration
                   <br/>
                   Stifled dreams
                   <br />
                   Thwarted ambitions
                   <br />
                   Dead end!
                   <br />
                   <br />
                   A woman's season is counting
                   <br />
                   They said a ring
                   <br />
                   Was the yardstick to be accepted 
                   <br />
                   A degree doesn't matter
                   <br />
                   But how flat the breast can fall 
                   <br />
                   From being suckled
                   <br />
                   <br />
                   30
                   <br />
                   I am not weak just because 
                   <br />
                   My heart feels so heavy.
                   <br />
                   <br />
                   I should say yes to papa Chike
                   <br />
                   He helped me start my kunu business
                   <br />
                   Even if my dreams don't become reality
                   <br />
                   Perhaps, my Ada might be the next computer scientist
